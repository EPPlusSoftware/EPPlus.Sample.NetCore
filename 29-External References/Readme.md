# 29 - External references
This example shows how to work with external references to other workbooks. 
EPPlus uses the external reference cache when calculating formulas. 
The external workbook can also be loaded to update the cache or calculate use values directly from the external workbook.
EPPlus also loads and preserves DDE and OLE links.
